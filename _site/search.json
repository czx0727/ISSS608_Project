From 2021 to 2022, the consumption levels off, showing stability in usage with no significant increase or decrease.\n\nThis trend suggests that until 2022, households were either using more electricity over time or more households were added to the grid, increasing total consumption.\n\n\nPublic vs Private Housing: Household Electricity Consumption Trend Across the Years\nIn the dataset itself, we can find the total household electricity annually by filtering the month column to only include Annual and DWELLING_TYPE to only include Public Housing and Private Housing.\n\n# Filter for only Private and Public Housing\ndata_filtered &lt;- SES_4 %&gt;% \n  filter(DWELLING_TYPE %in% c(\"Private Housing\", \"Public Housing\"), month == \"Annual\")\n\n# Aggregate electricity consumption by month and dwelling type\n# Ensure 'month' is correctly formatted for your dataset.
