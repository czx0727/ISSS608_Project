From 2021 to 2022, the consumption levels off, showing stability in usage with no significant increase or decrease.\n\nThis trend suggests that until 2022, households were either using more electricity over time or more households were added to the grid, increasing total consumption.\n\n\nPublic vs Private Housing: Household Electricity Consumption Trend Across the Years\nIn the dataset itself, we can find the total household electricity annually by filtering the month column to only include Annual and DWELLING_TYPE to only include Public Housing and Private Housing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivate Housing:\n\n\nFrom 2005 to around 2019, there is a gradual increase in electricity consumption in private housing.\nThe trend shows some fluctuations but the general direction is upward.\nBy the end of this period, the consumption seems to plateau or slightly decrease.\n\n\nPublic Housing:\n\n\nThe electricity consumption for public housing starts higher than private housing in 2005 and shows an overall increasing trend.\nWhile there are fluctuations, the trend does not show any significant drops and generally maintains an upward trajectory through the period observed.\n\n\nComparison:\n\n\nPublic housing consistently uses more electricity than private housing throughout the period from 2005 to 2023.\nThe difference between public and private housing electricity consumption appears to be relatively constant, with no closing of the gap observed.\n\n\nStability:\n\n\nBoth private and public housing show some year-to-year variability; however, there are no drastic changes like the one seen in the last year, which we are disregarding due to incomplete data.\n\n\nTrends Over Time:\n\n\nThe overall trend for both types of housing is increasing electricity consumption over the 15-year period.\nThere is no data to suggest any long-term decrease in consumption for either housing type within the period considered.\n\nWith this in mind, the graph indicates that both private and public housing had an increasing demand for electricity from 2005 to around 2022, with public housing having a consistently higher consumption level throughout the observed period.\n\n\nDifferent Dwelling Types: Household Electricity Consumption Trend Across the Years\nIn the dataset itself, we can find the total household electricity annually by filtering the month column to only include Annual and DWELLING_TYPE to include all the dwelling types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistics on Dwelling Types"
